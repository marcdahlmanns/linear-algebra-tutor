Users no longer need\nto memorize commands - just type ''linalg-tutor'' and follow the menus!\n\nNew Features:\n\nMain Menu System:\n- Default command now shows interactive menu instead of help\n- Main menu with Continue/Select Chapter/Progress/Practice/Settings\n- Chapter selection menu with all 10 topics\n- Per-chapter menus with practice/visualizations/solvers options\n- Settings menu with reset and data location viewing\n- Full keyboard navigation \\(arrow keys, enter, Ctrl+C\\)\n\nSession State Management:\n- Automatic progress saving to ~/.linalg_tutor/data/session_state.json\n- Tracks current chapter, completed topics, in-progress topics\n- Resume learning from where you left off\n- \"Continue Learning\" option appears when you have progress\n- Total exercises and time tracking\n- Progress percentage calculation \\(chapters completed / 10\\)\n\n10-Chapter Learning Path:\n1. Vectors → 2. Matrices → 3. Linear Systems → 4. Vector Spaces →\n5. Orthogonality → 6. Determinants → 7. Eigenvalues → 8. Transformations →\n9. Decompositions → 10. Applications\n\nChapter progression:\n- Automatic advancement to next chapter on completion\n- Status indicators: ✓ Complete, ⚡ In Progress, → Current, ○ Not Started\n- Recommended chapter based on progress\n- Mark topics complete to unlock next content\n\nPer-Chapter Options:\n- Practice Curated Exercises \\(hand-crafted with hints\\)\n- Generate Practice Problems \\(infinite randomized\\)\n- View Visualizations \\(commands shown\\)\n- Advanced Solvers \\(commands shown\\)\n\nUser Experience:\n- No commands to memorize - everything menu-driven\n- Graceful Ctrl+C handling throughout\n- Progress automatically saved after each session\n- Clean, organized interface with Rich formatting\n- Clear status indicators and progress visualization\n\nBackward Compatibility:\n- All original commands still work \\(exercise, generate, visualize, solve\\)\n- Expert users can skip menus and use commands directly\n- Menu system is optional enhancement, not requirement\n\nTechnical Details:\n- Session state stored in JSON format\n- LearningPath Pydantic model for validation\n- SessionState class manages state persistence\n- GuidedLearningApp controller for main loop\n- MainMenu UI components for display\n- Integration with existing ProgressTracker\n\nTesting:\n- 20 new automated tests \\(12 unit + 8 integration\\)\n- All 31 existing tests still pass \\(no regressions\\)\n- 51/51 tests passing \\(100% success rate\\)\n- Session state: 90% code coverage\n- Progress tracker: 80% code coverage\n- Complete user journey tested\n\nFiles Created:\n- linalg_tutor/core/progress/session_state.py \\(195 lines\\)\n- linalg_tutor/cli/ui/main_menu.py \\(278 lines\\)\n- linalg_tutor/cli/guided_app.py \\(403 lines\\)\n- tests/unit/test_progress/test_session_state.py \\(12 tests\\)\n- tests/integration/test_guided_app.py \\(8 tests\\)\n- GUIDED_LEARNING.md \\(complete user guide\\)\n- TEST_RESULTS_GUIDED_LEARNING.md \\(test results\\)\n\nFiles Modified:\n- linalg_tutor/cli/app.py \\(callback to launch menu by default\\)\n- linalg_tutor/core/progress/__init__.py \\(export new classes\\)\n\nUsage:\nSimply type ''linalg-tutor'' and navigate with arrow keys!\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")",
